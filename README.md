# The Baby Equipment Exchange

## Introduction...

This project assists the collection and distribution of unused and gently used baby and child equipment. Over twenty different organizations are served by this exchange.

## Setup

[Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) and [clone](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) the repository to your local machine.

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed on your machine.

Navigate to the cloned repository on your computer, open a terminal and the run command

```
npm install
```

to install the project dependencies.

Running the app requires an '.env.local' file in the root of the project folder to access the project's environment variables. You can request this file in the [baby-equipment-exchange Slack channel](https://codeforbtv.slack.com/archives/C04HA6P9Z2R).

Once this file is in place, you can launch the app by running the command

```
npm run dev
```

in your terminal. The app can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
