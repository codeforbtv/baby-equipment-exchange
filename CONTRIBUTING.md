# Contributing to the Baby Product Exchange Project

## Starting Notes

We welcome community contributions and appreciate the help with our work!
That said we need to level-set on a couple items right up-front.

- Contributions and Contributors Must Follow the Code for BTV Code of Conduct https://codeforbtv.org/code-conduct/
- Contributions are open source and will adhere to the project license (MIT License)

## How to Engage

New contributors should be aware that we are not winging-it or working without a plan.
We have a plan. Sometimes we are better than other times at clearly sharing it, but it exists if you ask.
Because we are all volunteers, there may be miscommunication, and mistakes in contributed code or artifacts.
Let us be empathetic towards eachother in this regard. Not every contributor is a master 20 year professional developer. Most are just learning.
If you need more rigor and professionalism you are welcome to lay out plans for how to accomplish that yourself, or give feedback to the current project manager.

## Tasks, Tickets, Issues

Most of our work to be done should be captured into either a Github Issue for the repo, or in the Github project.
Some of the tickets in the project are assigned. Some are not. If they are not assigned, you may assign them to yourself.
If they are already assigned you can check in our Slack with the person who is assigned and see if they are indeed working on it.

If you see something that seems like an issue, then file it as an issue in the repo.
At some point later it should be elevated by the project manager to become a ticket.
If you see an issue that you want to work on and it is not a ticket, first try to ask the Project Manager to make it a ticket.
If you cannot reach the project manager, then you may try to make it a ticket yourself, and then assign it to yourself and work on it.

## Commiting Updates

Repo admins may commit and push to main, and manage merges and PRs.

Other contributors should plan to fork and submit PRs.

Submitted PRs are most-often reviewed and merged during Action Nights. This is not a rule, it is just how it generally goes.
If you need a PR merged, and you've made sure there are no conflicts etc., you can ping the repo admins on Slack, or by e-mail.
Remember that the repo-admins are volunteers too and have busy lives like most people, so it can take a few days to reach them sometimes.

## Deadlines, Sprints, Rhythms

If there is a set deadline for certain tickets, it will be communicated in either Slack or at an Action Night meeting.

Because we are all volunteers, we cannot really perform in sprints. The closest thing to a sprint is us trying to make progress between Action Nights.

If you have vastly more free time and efficiency than the admins for the repo, we may seem slow to you. We're all doing what we can.
If you perform well and thoughtfully and prove yourself trustworthy, you may be nominated to become and admin.
Admins are not gods or dictators - they are just the most trusted folks involved in the project.

## Coding Style

There is no Code for BTV code style guide. Please attempt to write clear, commented code. Use long variable names.
Try to make it obvious why something is present.
Because not all contributors are master coders, saying that the code is the best documentation is not super helpful.
Some very junior contributors may be trying to pitch in and help and learn ... and yet may get lost easily of the code is written without clarity in mind.

## Secrets

Most projects require secrets... tokens, keys, passwords, etc.

Most of our projects use a .env file. It should _NEVER_ be committed to the repo - because the repos are public.
As such you won't (shouldn't) find it here. Or if you do it may be a placeholder with fake values.
Either way, you will usually need to acquire a secrets file (.env file probably) from an existing developer working on the project.
Just reach ou in the Slack channel or one of the repo admins.
